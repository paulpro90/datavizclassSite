  <p>Hello, Iâ€™m Paul, a New York based architect and designer. 
	I studied architecture at the University of Michigan where I received my B.S. in Architecture in 2013.
	I am currently working on my M.Arch at Columbia University and will graduate in 2019. 
	Before attending graduate school, I worked in health care design in San Francisco. I bring five years of professional architecture experience
	to the table.
	Thank you for checking out my work.
